General Assembly Project 1

API: https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/

LIVE site: https://haileedoyle.github.io/GA_Project_1/

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, and jQuery /Javascript / AJAX.

Approach: Come up with problem / resource objective for users. Wireframe, and begin with boilerplate. Came up with UI mod as I went along to figure out what best would fit the page, format, and purpose of the site. Once HTML base and minor CSS was set, focused completely on AJAX, etc. I wrote a schedule for what I wanted and needed to accomplish every day to keep myself on track.

Challenges / Unsolved Problems: Responsive design format was a bit difficult. The images a sizing down to fit the smaller screen, but they're too small. I also couldn't figure out how to add a reset button so user wouldn't have to refresh page every time they wanted to do a new search.
I realized once all my code was written that if I search for Films, the results are shown, and then if I click through the back or next buttons, the results for the search continue to append to the list. I looked through my code to see why or where that could be coming from, but couldn't figure it out.
